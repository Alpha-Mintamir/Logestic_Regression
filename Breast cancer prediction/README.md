# Logistic Regression Project

This project focuses on performing logistic regression analysis using Python for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning tasks. The project is structured with multiple components, including Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis, Python scripts for reusable functions, and organized directories for data storage and logging.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **Notebook/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks that handle data exploration, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Scripts/**: Holds Python scripts for plotting, data utility functions, and logging configuration.
- **Data/**: Stores the raw and processed data files in CSV format.
- **Logs/**: Contains log files generated by the Python scripts during execution to track events, errors, and successful operations.

### 1. Notebook Folder

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for conducting data analysis and implementing the logistic regression model.

#### Notable Notebook:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb**:

  - Loads the dataset, performs initial exploration, checks for missing values, and visualizes data.
  - Conducts univariate and bivariate analysis, and generates a correlation matrix for numeric variables.
  - Prepares cleaned data for further analysis and saves the processed dataset.

  Key sections in this notebook:

  - **Data Loading**: Loading the dataset from the `Data/` folder.
  - **Missing Value Handling**: Detecting and removing missing data.
  - **Univariate Analysis**: Visualization of individual variables.
  - **Bivariate Analysis**: Exploration of relationships between two variables.
  - **Correlation Matrix**: Visualizing the correlations between numeric variables.

  Example usage:

  ```python
  df = pd.read_csv('../Data/data.csv')
  plot_univariate_analysis(df, df.columns)
  ```

### 2. Scripts Folder

This folder contains reusable Python scripts for data visualization and utilities. It is designed to keep the code modular and easy to maintain.

#### Scripts:

- **plottings.py**:

  - Contains functions for univariate and bivariate plotting using seaborn and matplotlib.
  - Logs both successful operations and any errors encountered during plotting.

  Example functions:

  ```python
  plot_univariate_analysis(df, df.columns)
  plot_bivariate_analysis(df, columns)
  ```

- **utils.py**:

  - Provides utility functions for checking missing values and generating column summaries.
  - Logs function calls and error messages during execution.

  Example functions:

  ```python
  missing_values_table(df)
  column_summary(df)
  ```

#### Logging:

The scripts in this folder log events in two separate files:

- **info.log**: Logs successful operations and processes.
- **error.log**: Logs any errors encountered during script execution.

The log files are stored in the `Logs/` folder.

### 3. Data Folder

The `Data/` folder holds all datasets used in this project. These datasets are typically in CSV format and are loaded into the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for analysis.

#### Files:

- **data.csv**: The raw dataset used for analysis.
- **data_cleaned.csv**: The processed dataset after cleaning, stored for further analysis or model building.

### 4. Logs Folder

This folder contains the log files generated by the scripts in the `Scripts` folder. Logs help to monitor the flow of execution and identify any errors or issues during runtime.

#### Log Files:

- **info.log**: Contains messages related to successful operations and processes.
- **error.log**: Contains error messages that occur during execution, useful for debugging.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies**: Install all required libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up the project structure**: Ensure the folder structure is as follows:

   ```lua
   Logistic Regression/
   ├── Data/
   │   ├── data.csv
   │   └── data_cleaned.csv
   ├── Logs/
   │   ├── info.log
   │   └── error.log
   ├── Notebook/
   │   └── Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb
   ├── Scripts/
   │   ├── plottings.py
   │   └── utils.py
   └── README.md
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Start the analysis by opening the `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Use the Python scripts**: You can reuse the plotting and utility functions from the `Scripts` folder within your notebooks or other Python scripts.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- logging

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn logging
```

## Summary

This project demonstrates the implementation of logistic regression analysis, starting from data exploration, cleaning, and visualization, followed by model building. The modular structure, with reusable scripts for plotting and utility functions, ensures maintainability and scalability of the code. Logging functionality helps track the execution flow and debug issues.
